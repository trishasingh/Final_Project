**Abstract**: I examine how the prevalence of the caste system in India varies with socio-economic status. Specifically, I answer the question: “When seeking a marriage partner, is the importance given to the partner’s caste related to a person’s income or education?”

I find strong statistically significant relationships between socioeconomic status and attitude towards the caste system. Every $1000 increase in annual income is correlated with a 0.3 percent decrease in probability of having a preference for partner's caste. Additionally, I find that a person with a Master’s degree is 7.5 percentage points less likely and a person with a Professional degree is 15 percentage points less likely to have caste preferences than someone with a Bachelor’s degree. A person working in the public sector is 9 percentage points more likely to give importance to parnter's caste than a person working in the private sector.
